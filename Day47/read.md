You are given a string of words. Some of the words in the string
contain uppercase letters. Write a code that will return all the
words that have an uppercase letter. Your code should return a list
of the words. Each word in the list should be reversed. Here is how
your output should look:
['gninrAel', 'tUb', 'uoY', 'yLppa', 'flesRuoy', 'eVeihca']
