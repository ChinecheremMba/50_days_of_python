Write a function called make_tuples that takes two equal lists and combines them into a list of tuples. Your code should check that the input lists are of the same length. For example, if list a is [1, 2, 3, 4] and list b is [5, 6, 7, 8], your function should return [(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8)]. If the lists are not of equal length,your function should raise a ValueError.
